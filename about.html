        <p id="early">
            Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, was born and raised in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. 
            Having always had an interest in music his first music performance was in middle school where he sang
             Juanes's song "Mala Gente". He came up with his stage name looking back at image where he was forced to 
             wear a bunny costome to school and appeared to be upset in the photo, thus giving himself the name 'Bad Bunny'. </p>
        <p id="first-songs">
            In 2013, Bad Bunny began to upload his songs on the music app SoundCloud. It wasn't until 2016 
            where he got the attention of DJ Luian for his song Diles. This song got him signed on to Dj Luian's Label "Hear This Music".
            From there, he continued to release singles such as "Soy Peor", and "Krippy Kush". Both of these singles were successful and so
            were his future singles "Ahora me llama", with Karol G, and "Mayores", with Becky G, and most recognized "Te bote". In 2017, 
            Bad Bunny's name could be found on 15 songs on the Billboard Hot Latin Chart. In 2018, Bad Bunny's fame only continued to rise. 
            Bad Bunny collaborated with artists such as Cardi B, and Drake. The song 
            "I Like It", sang with Cardi B and J Balvin, was Bad Bunny's first song on the US Billboard Hot 100.

            Soon after leaving his label "Hear This Music", Bad Bunny revealed that the reason as to why he has not released an album was
            because he was not allowed to do so, even though he produced all of his songs. So, after leaving the label Bad Bunny released 
            his first album, "x100pre" under Rimas Entertainment. The album received a rating of 84 on Metacritic, and later was placed on 
            Rolling Stone's industry-voted list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time at number 447.

            On June 2019, Bad Bunny released a joint album with J Balvin names "Oasis". Despite being a suprise album, it reached number 9 
            on Billboard Hot 100.
