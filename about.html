            Soon after leaving his label "Hear This Music", Bad Bunny revealed that the reason as to why he has not released an album was
            because he was not allowed to do so, even though he produced all of his songs. So, after leaving the label Bad Bunny released 
            his first album, "x100pre" under Rimas Entertainment. The album received a rating of 84 on Metacritic, and later was placed on 
            Rolling Stone's industry-voted list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time at number 447.
